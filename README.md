# File Hosting & Sharing Application

## Overview

This project is a simple **file hosting and sharing web application** with:

- **User registration and login**
- **JWT-based authentication**
- **File upload with privacy options (public / private)**
- **"My Files" page for logged-in user**
- **Public Downloads page for all public files**
- **Logout functionality**
The backend is built with **Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Atlas)** and the frontend is built with **plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no React).  

Once the server is running, the app can be used **directly from a web browser** by opening the HTML pages.
